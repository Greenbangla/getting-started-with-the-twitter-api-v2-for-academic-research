# Labs: Code samples in R and Python

![banner](../assets/banner.png)

Now that you have your bearer token, know what endpoints the Twitter API v2 has available and know how to write search queries, it is time to get into the code and actually get the data. 

- For Python samples, we will be using the [twarc](https://github.com/DocNow/twarc) library
- For R samples, we will be using the [academicTwitteR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/academictwitteR) package.

**Note:** Currently, the academicTwitteR package only supports certain endpoints in the academic research product track and **does not support the standard product track**, so if you are a student, please follow [the code samples for the standard product track in Python](./6b-labs-code-standard-python.md)
