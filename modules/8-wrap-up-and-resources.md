![banner](../assets/banner.png)

Congratulations! You have now completed this 101 course on getting started with the Twitter API v2 for academic research. If you were able to complete Modules 1-7, you are ahead of the game. ðŸŽ‰

Here is a recap of the things we learned in this course:

- What the Twitter API is and what are some examples of research done with it
- How to for a Twitter developer account and choose the right product track
- How to decide what endpoints to use, based on the data we need
- How to get the keys and bearer token from the developer dashboard
- How to write search queries

We also looked at code samples in Python and R, that covered various scenarios for getting Tweets using libraries for the Twitter API v2. Though you learned some of the fundamentals of calling the API directly in this course, these libraries and packages can give you a big head start.

Was this course helpful for you? **If you liked this course, please star this repository**. Over time, we will continue to update this course and add new code samples as new endpoints are launched to support academics. Weâ€™ll also add 200 and 300 level courses in the future, starting with a course on text analysis using Twitter data.

Stay updated with our future product releases on our [product roadmap](https://t.co/roadmap), or by following us on [@TwitterDev](https://twitter.com/twitterdev).

If you have questions about the Twitter API, including about anything you learned in this course, you can ask those on the Twitter community forums.
